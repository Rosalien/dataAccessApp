*"The SNO Tourbières observing system [https://www.sno-tourbieres.cnrs.fr/](https://www.sno-tourbieres.cnrs.fr/) was set up thanks to an incentive funding of the French Ministry of Research that allowed pooling together various pre-existing small scale observing setups. The continuity and long term perenity of the measurements are made possible by an undisrupted and continuous CNRS funding since 2008."*
